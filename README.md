 # Summary
 This semester, I learned how to work with a great deal of important machine learning algorithms, such as linear and logistic regression, kNN, k means clustering, and neural networks, among others. Above are the projects where I put these algorithms to work. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn about this algorithms, and now that I know them, I can put them to use in my personal projects. I hope to use future projects to both sharpen my skills in the area and keep up with new innovations in the field. I am greatly interested in pursuing a career in this field, and I look forward to any opportunities that arise in it.
